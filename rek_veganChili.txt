With rice, serves at least 8.

Ingredients:
 - 4 red bell peppers
 - 5 yellow onions
 - 1 stalk celery
 - 1 10oz bag of shredded carrots
 - 4 habanero peppers (I like it spicy!)
 - 1 bunch cilantro
 - 1 bag washed spinach
 - 2 limes
 - 2 cans diced tomatoes
 - 3 cans black beans, drained
 - 1 can kidney beans, drained
 - 3 tablespoons chili powder
 - 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
 - 2 teaspoons cumin
 - 1 tablespoon garlic powder
 - 4 teaspoons basil
 - 1 teaspoon ground oregano
 - 2 teaspoons ground turmeric

Directions:
 1. Chop red peppers, onions, celery. Toss into very large pot with shredded carrots.
 2. Finely chop habanero peppers and add to pot.
 3. Add water just below the height of the vegetables. Place on burner, begin to heat on high.
 4. Add tomatoes and beans.
 5. Boil for 10-15 minutes, occasionally pulling pot off and stirring bottom.
 6. While boiling, rinse cilantro under running water and then soak in a large mixing bowl.
 7. After much of the excess water is boiled off, add spices and stir thoroughly.
 8. Add limes, squeezed.
 9. Cover and simmer for at least 45 minutes.
 10. Remove soaked cilantro and chop finely. Add to pot.
 11. Add spinach gradually; as it soaks it will occupy less space.
 12. Enjoy! For best results, serve over brown rice. Freeze leftovers for future dinners.
